Here's the deal, we really don't allow advertising. Haupt wanted to monetize his content and couldn't accept that we won't allow him to do whatever he wants. After he started posting patreon links and spamming his social media I decided I had to figure something out.\n\nSo, I tried to work with him for a while. I even ended up making him a mod to try to get him to chill the fuck out. Not sure why I thought that would help but it didn't. One of the higher ups noticed his advertising activity and immediately removed him as mod. I'm surprised he wasn't banned then.\n\nAfter already bending over backward a whole ton, I even made a guide for this guy on how he can not get banned. It is listed on the FAQ. **I literally gave the man a way to make money from his memes** **without running afoul of our rules** and gave him a shitload of chances and he immediately sends me a snotty message about it and breaks the rules.\n\nWSB isn't a very serious place, but we're serious about not wanting to ruin the community by letting people turn it into a directory of penny stock scammers and patreon links. I really tried to find some middle ground with this guy but it couldn't be done, so I banned him. I really wanted to keep him around for the content but he just won't chill.\n\nI have all the conversations screenshotted and I have plenty of proof of him referencing his patreon and even [admitting himself he knows we don't like him doing that, then doing it again](https://i.gyazo.com/dc2d9f7f3daa6cd41f6098cf568a9d3b.png), so there is no excuse.\n\nThis has been a learning experience for me to not cater to unreasonable people even if they make dank memes. It won't be repeated.\n\n**EDIT:** Added a bit of proof. There's more but this is already really gay.\n\nLook, I like the guy's memes, I'm sorry how it turned out, but we can't just let people we like break all the fucking rules. WSB would be shitty.

Im referring to the short-term outlook report by EIA today (12pm), OPEC meeting tomorrow, and IEA report on Thursday  (on top of the standard weekly API report and Weekly EIA report).\n\nThis week has the potential to go either direction depending on how things play out\n\nThe good: Genscape who I trust more than any other analyst group (even more than API) is  expecting a crude draw this week. Tropical storm gordon although not as strong as expected did have an impact on supply as wellwhere analyst estimate about a decrease of 100k barrels a day \n\nAdditionally, as I mentioned yesterday, the spread between WTI crude and Brent is the highest it's been in awhile ($10 spread). Why is this important? Because it makes WTI crude much more appealing price wise as opposed to Brent, the effect being that Korea and Japan have significantly increased their imports from the US since the start of September. 200k of barrels a day to Korea and 100k to Japan is what's being estimated. India has also went on to say that it would not being ordering from Iran come October and will likely replace that oil (some) with WTI crude. \n\nAlso, Canada is continuing NAFTA talks today and any kind of progress/deal being made would be good for crude prices. US met with EU as well over trade and could also benefit crude.\n\nThe bad: There are talks going around that OPEC might agree to up their production by an additional 1 million barrels a day to offset the lack of supply coming from Iran, Venezuela, and Libya. Now this could have an affect on WTI crude prices because it would bring down the price of brent and make the price more appealing again to other countries. With that being said, some people are saying that OPEC may not have the spare production capacity to meet the demand in this tightened oil market. We will have a clearer picture when Saudi Arabia releases it's production numbers for August. So that's a toss up.\n\nAdditionally, sept 15 in considered the end of the driving season and we typically see a drop in gasoline prices as refineries switch other to cheaper winter blends. A big reason for the drop last week was due to a build in gas and distillates regardless of the crude draw. Analyst are mixed on gas builds/draws this week, we will have a better picture when API releases their report. \n\nOn top of all that, the on going China trade war is bad for crude, so trump tweeting anything implying an escalation could affect prices as well.\n\nFor now I'm holding on to my Calls, but I'll be watching things very closely this week.\n"", 'What is it with MU that makes people buy??

Mnuchin has led a recent overture to the Chinese to re-start trade talks.\n\nThe public comment period for a list of tariffs on about $200 billion in Chinese goods closed last week, and Trump said the duties would be imposed â€œsoon.â€?The new round would be in addition to $50 billion in Chinese goods that already face a 25 percent duty.\n\nThe Chinese have retaliated with tariffs on an equivalent amount of U.S. exports, and have promised to match future rounds of U.S. duties.\n\nBefore his meeting on Thursday, Trump boasted on Twitter that he has the upper hand in the trade feud with Beijing and feels â€œno pressureâ€?to resolve the dispute.\n\nHis comment tempered cautious optimism among investors over the U.S. governmentâ€™s proposal for another round of talks with Beijing. Disclosure on Wednesday that the U.S. sought to renew the talks rallied U.S. stocks and emerging-market assets.\n\nTrump threatened a third tranche of tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese imports last week, which would mean levying duties on nearly everything China exports to the U.S. Trump said at the time those tariffs were â€œready to go on short notice,â€?but the administration hasnâ€™t yet published a list for public comment.\n\nEfforts to end the dispute have fizzled so far. Officials from both countries have met four times for formal talks, most recently in August, when Treasuryâ€™s undersecretary for international affairs, David Malpass, led discussions in Washington with Chinese Vice Minister Wang Shouwen.\n\nThe White House has sought to pressure Beijing to reduce its trade surplus with America and protect intellectual property rights of U.S. companies, which it says are abused in China.\n\n\\--With assistance from Justin Sink, Andrew Mayeda and Shawn Donnan.', 'Is this thread auto sorting by NEW now?

Up 20% this week with a $3k account balance that was at $8k the beginning of OCT. My low was about $1k. My breakeven at this point is $7k.\n3. Lessons:\n   1. HOLD LONG POSITIONS even in times of doubt. Example: I had Nov. calls on SBUX and Puts on GE that would have saved my account balance but I let them go for break even or a little more. My gut was to keep these but weak hands are weak hands.\n   2. Don't react to day-to-day movements unless you're skilled, can afford the losses or focused on day trading. Noob emotions will ruin you fast. Your actual job is more important.\n   3. Focus only on a small amount of positions/companies that you are confident about. At one point I think I had 30 open positions and most were garbage YOLO's. I fed into the FOMO.\n   4. CLOSE SHORT TERM POSITIONS if you're closing in on expiry and losing or only slightly winning (unless you have insider knowledge or solid DD otherwise). Stop being greedy or overly optimistic. The best trades I see on here are big money positions that makes 10-25% quickly. Burn a day trade if you have to. Don't overextend yourself with FD's that trick you into holding. Example: One day a couple weeks ago I was up  80% to $1800 on TWTR calls. I held looking for more loot and they expired worthless.  I had multiple chances to pull the money at break-even or minor losses. I didn't want to be wrong. I was wrong.\n   5.

Their whole company culture is unlike anything I've seen in other companies. From the way they treat their employees to their commission structure, which is like a split commission among all the educators (sales ppl) for reaching goals. If you've ever visited the store you'll notice the employees are typically super fucking positive. This is because they are big on work/life balance. Won't allow you to close and reopen the next morning. Give you money for gym or classes. Pay their employees to visit local sporting events like marathons or yoga classes to give out free shit like $70 yoga mats to the whole class.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside for their culture, their return approach is top fucking notch. Better than Nordstrom's pre-nerf one. I've gone in there with a 2 year old $150 dress shirt that I wasn't supposed to dry that was in 3 separate pieces and they gave me full store credit for it. I've seen them do this for thousands of dollars of used several year old clothing for their loyal customers. This isn't company policy, but more so at the discretion of the educators.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn top of all of this, their clothing actually is very high quality in my own opinion. Speaking as someone who has spent hundreds of dollars on other brand plain tees only to wear them once and have them shrink, I have no problem spending $58 on a lulu plain black tee shirt. They are well made, soft, unshrinkable, and have an athletic fit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake all of this with a grain of salt though. It is only my experience. I personally believe all of this shit creates the annoying kool-aid drinking cult following LULU has. What other company is competing in this space? Gap's Athletica? They don't even carry men's clothing and I've never met anyone wearing it. Nike/ Adidas are both in their own space and aren't as fashionable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure about buying calls in today's market and I personally wouldn't advise it just because of how irrational it is, but I don't see LULU going anywhere anytime soon. Sorry about the wall of text. Hope this helps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: LULU is a solid company with a cult following, quality products, and typically crushes around Christmas.
